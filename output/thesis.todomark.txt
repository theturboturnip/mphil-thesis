TODOs
1
thesis.tex- Should the hypothesis reproductions also be counted?
2
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- diagram
3
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- appendix - the program flow for using modules
4
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- appx - Decision tree for operation decoding?
5
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- fix
6

7
1_30Software/content.tex- example based on \url {https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/blob/master/examples/rvv_memcpy.c}
8

1_30Software/content.tex- Appendix which covers what I know so far about this problem?
10
1_30Software/content.tex- Example https://godbolt.org/z/KPTW7rcvY
11
1_30Software/sub50_hyp.tex- violate? exceed?
12
1_30Software/sub50_hyp.tex- Put the compatibility preprocessor stuff in the compiler appendix
13
2_1Appendix/cherirvv.tex- CHERI-RVV changes RVV instructions to use capabilities as address references in all places, no other behaviour changes
14
2_1Appendix/cherirvv.tex- CHERI-RVV treats capability out-of-bounds for an element as a synchronous exception, permission checks for a vector access are treated as a synchronous exception on element 0.
15
2_1Appendix/cherirvv.tex- The above means fault-only-first will silently swallow capability permission errors if element 0 is masked out.
16
2_1Appendix/cherirvv.tex- CHERI-RVV doesn't change CHERI behaviour
17
2_1Appendix/cherirvv.tex- Adds unit load/store 128, element width 128
18
2_1Appendix/artifacts.tex- artifacts appendix needs fixing
19
2_1Appendix/artifacts.tex- make sure to redact online copies
