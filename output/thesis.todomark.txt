1_10Introduction/content.tex- explain Scalable vectors
4
1_10Introduction/content.tex- nine
5
1_10Introduction/content.tex- fill out this para more, have an actual end sentence
6
1_20Background/sub30_rvv_model.tex- examples
7
1_20Background/sub35_rvv_memory.tex- Make thinner
8
1_20Background/sub50_cheri.tex- add diagram from TR-941?
9
1_20Background/sub50_cheri.tex- diagram for split/merged register file?
10
1_20Background/sub50_cheri.tex- is there rationale for that documented somewhere?
11
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- table of relevant structures/functions?
12
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- C code wasn't documented, Rust is
13
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- move markdown documentation into rust :)
14
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- documentation is available on a github.io, not crates.io yet because I don't have access to CSTRD-CHERI and they'd likely want to host it
15
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- diagram
16
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub10_emu_cheri.tex- show the program flow for using modules
17
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- short definition of provenance
18
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- diagram of floating point ld/st vs. vector ld/st
19
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- Decision tree for operation decoding
20
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub20_emu_vec.tex- appendix XYZ
21
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- fast-path could be split up? i.e. for LMUL = 8, could execute a fast-path for each register in the group rather than all 8 at once
22
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- if an address range is calculated then: if capability contains it: SUCCESS else if it was wide or FoF: Likely-Failure else: FAILURE
23
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- if an address range isn't calculated: Unchecked
24
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- Put the above into an algorithm format
25
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- iterating over elements may still be more energy-efficient than doing individual capability checks?
26
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub30_fast_path.tex- Note that the equation is a simplification of strided for \code {stride = nf * eew}
27
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub50_hyp.tex- In a theoretical sense, definitely - $n$ individual checks can be replaced by 1 check, amortizing whatever the cost is
28
1_25EmulationInvestigation/sub50_hyp.tex- Evaluate cost in a hardware sense: compare a theoretical implementation which does each per-element check, potentially $m$ checks in parallel to issue $m$ requests in parallel, all pipelined with the actual accesses, vs. hardware that has a single capability check at the start which blocks it from initiating any accesses.
29
1_25EmulationInvestigation/content.tex- where to note that capability checks count as a synchronous exception? centralized point for "here are the differences between RVV and CHERI-RVV?
30
1_25EmulationInvestigation/content.tex- I wrote a type-safe wrapper for capabilities
31
1_30Software/content.tex- is it called that?
32
1_30Software/content.tex- Figure page showing generated ASM for increment loop - see godbolt links MD
33
1_30Software/content.tex- example based on \url {https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/blob/master/examples/rvv_memcpy.c}
34
1_30Software/content.tex- Hammer home that intrinsics aren't reusable across instruction sets? e.g. AVX intrinsics don't work with RISC-V
35
1_30Software/content.tex- example
36
1_30Software/content.tex- the previous sentence kinda sucks at getting the point across. Using a constraint forces the compiler to move the value into a register/memory
37
1_30Software/content.tex- example
38
1_30Software/content.tex- example
39
1_30Software/content.tex- example of CHERI-agnostic inline assembly
40
1_30Software/content.tex- Beautify this table
41
1_30Software/content.tex- appendix based on \url {https://godbolt.org/z/zoWh9jq3o}
42
1_30Software/content.tex- Appendix on how this was done?
43
1_30Software/content.tex- Example
44
1_30Software/content.tex- example
45
1_30Software/content.tex- example of error message?
46
1_30Software/content.tex- Appendix which covers what I know so far about this problem?
47
1_30Software/content.tex- segue into saving registers on stack doesn't make sense - doesn't explain why someone would want to
48
1_30Software/content.tex- Example https://godbolt.org/z/KPTW7rcvY
49
1_30Software/content.tex- Note: Arm Language C extensions https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100987/0000/ defines the concept of a sizeless type, which may be stored on the stack. Would be a good base for RVV?
50
1_30Software/content.tex- LLVM IR pass is investigated in TR-949 \$3.8.2, worth noting somewhere
51
1_50Evaluation/content.tex- Summarize hypotheses outcomes
52
1_50Evaluation/content.tex- Summarize results
53
1_50Evaluation/content.tex- List artifacts - github repositories, where to get the rust-cheri-compressed-cap crate etc
54
2_1Appendix/building_riscv_v_gnu.tex- verify - do a fresh clone and see
55
2_1Appendix/building_riscv_v_gnu.tex- Example
56
2_1Appendix/building_riscv_v_gnu.tex- clone submodules (macOS guy turns off SSL for this?)
57
2_1Appendix/building_riscv_v_gnu.tex- Configure with as many risc-v exts as possible
58
2_1Appendix/building_riscv_v_gnu.tex- Does RISC-V GCC 10.2 support vector intrinsics if you compile with v?
