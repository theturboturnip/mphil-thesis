CHERI, a generic architecture extension which improves memory safety, has garnered attention from industry partners for its low overhead and compatibility with existing source code. CHERI has been adapted to multiple ISAs, including Arm and RISC-V, but not to their scalable vector extensions (Arm SVE and RISC-V "V"/RVV). These extensions use a "vector-length agnostic programming model" to allow hardware flexibility, and as such are meant to remain relevant long into the future, so it is essential for CHERI to support them.

This project focuses on RVV, presenting and evaluating a "CHERI-RVV" combination ISA by building/testing a reference implementation. We find that RVV is adaptable to CHERI with no issues, although other models like Arm SVE may require more investigation. We find a set of issues with the current CHERI compiler that make source-level compatibility difficult, and show they can be easily resolved with engineering effort. We explore storing capabilities-in-vectors to allow `memcpy` with vector instructions, and show it does not violate security properties.

We conclude that it is viable to combine RVV with CHERI to enable vectorized arithmetic and `memcpy` operations without sacrificing performance, source-level compatibility, or memory protection.
