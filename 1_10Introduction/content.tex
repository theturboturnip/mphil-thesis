\todomark{para on what vectors are}

\todomark{para on what capabilities are}

\todomark{above paras should explain why the interactions between the two are interesting}

\section{Motivation}
\todomark{rvv introduces vectors for RVV}
\todomark{rvv is scalable vector}
\todomark{CHERI has a RISC-V ISA + various implementations, wants to support vectors}

\todomark{vectorized memory accesses required for vectorized arithmetic}
\todomark{Necessary for CHERI support in order for CHERI performance to be competitive}
\todomark{if this were the only priority, vectorized memory access doesn't need to be that fast relative to arithmetic?}

\todomark{memcpy is a very common operation, vectorized on many platforms (cite)}
\todomark{thus memory accesses themselves should be optimized}
\todomark{also raises the question of storing capabilities within vectors, which could be useful for revocation strategies as proposed in XYZ}

\todomark{scalable vector support useful for future Arm support}
\todomark{Current Morello doesn't support Arm SVE/NEON (cite?) despite the base Neoverse N1 supporting it (cite??)}

\section{Aims}

Investigate the reprecussions of adding scalable vector support to CHERI systems.
\todomark{Identify where potential roadblocks could be, and where they couldn't be.}
% What are potential performance/compatibility roadblocks?

\todomark{Investigate from both hardware and software perspectives}

\todomark{Investigate from both (adding CHERI to vector) and (adding vectors to CHERI) perspectives}

% How does CHERI impact vector implementations (i.e. storing capabilities inside vectors for generic memcpy)
% How do vectors impact CHERI implementations (particularly scalable vectors?)
