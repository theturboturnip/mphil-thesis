\section{Initial Smoke Tests}
Some simple smoke tests were constructed to test the basic functionality of the emulator, particularly under CHERI.
\code{hello\_world} runs three small functions which calculate Fibonacci numbers and factorials.
Fibonacci is calculated with a simple recursive function, and with \emph{memoization} where previous outputs are cached in a static array.
The tests compile on all compilers, and output the correct results on all architectures.

\section{\code{vector\_memcpy}}
The scope of this test, including testing many permutations of \code{vtype}, meant the full table couldn't be included in the main paper.

\section{\code{vector\_memcpy\_pointers}}
This is already referenced in the main paper (\todoref{vectormemcpypointers}) and included here for completeness.\\
