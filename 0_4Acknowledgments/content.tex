  There are many people aside from me who have contributed to the success of this project.
  It would have been much more difficult without them, so I'd like to take a moment to thank them here.

  Firstly my supervisor, Simon Moore, has been a huge asset throughout, always willing to answer my questions when needed.
  This project is but one small part of CHERI, and his advice helped me find where my project fit in the grand scheme of things.

  Speaking of CHERI, this project builds on work done since CHERI's inception in 2014.
  Jon Woodruff and Jessica Clarke helped me navigate this vast sea of prior work, identifying resources and problem areas for me to use/address.

  I'd also like to thank my father, Gavin Stark, for many helpful technical conversations on the project; and the rest of my family and Elizabeth Yallop for help on the less technical elements of this dissertation.
