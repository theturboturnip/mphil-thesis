Largest impact of adding vectors to scalar languages = how to generate vector code.
Is it automatic?
Are there intrinsics?
Is assembly feasible?
How does ARM handle this vs. RVV?

Largest impact of adding CHERI to previously insecure languages = memory safety :D.
How must the vector instructions change to support capabilities? i.e. go into clang and use GPCRC.
Can you store vectors on the stack?

Unique intersection between CHERI + vectors: capabilities-in-vectors
Do we need new instructions for performing capability operations on caps-in-vectors?
