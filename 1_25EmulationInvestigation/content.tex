\chapter{Hardware emulation investigation\label{chap:hardware}}
In order to experiment with integrating CHERI and RVV, we implemented a RISC-V emulator in the Rust programming language named \code{riscv-v-lite}.
The emulator can partially emulate four unprivileged\footnote{i.e. entirely bare-metal without privilege levels for OSs or hypervisors.} RISC-V ISAs (\cref{tab:emu_arches}), and was also used as the base for capabilities-in-vectors research (\cref{chap:capinvec}).
This chapter explores the development of the emulator, the implementation of CHERI support (including supplementary libraries), the addition of vector support, and the conclusions drawn about CHERI-RVV.

\section{Developing the emulator}\label{chap:software:sec:emu}

Each architecture is simulated in the same way.
A \code{Processor} struct holds the register file and memory, and a separate \code{ProcessorModules} struct holds the ISA modules the architecture can use.
% A separate \code{ProcessorModules} struct holds all ISA modules the processor can execute (e.g. the base RV64 Integer ISA, the Multiply extension, and the Vector extension).
Each ISA module uses a ``connector'' struct to manipulate data in the \code{Processor}.
% The gap between the \code{Processor} and the ISA modules is bridged by a module-specific ``connector'' struct, which holds references to data in the \code{Processor} that is required by the ISA module.
For example, the RV64 Integer ISA's connector contains the current PC, a virtual reference to a register file, and a virtual reference to memory.
This allows different \code{Processor} structs (e.g. a normal RV64 and a CHERI-enabled RV64) to reuse the same ISA modules despite using different register file implementations.

Each \code{Processor} implements a single stage pipeline.
Instructions are fetched, decoded with a common decoder function\footnote{The decoder, and therefore all emulated processors, doesn't support RISC-V Compressed instructions.}, and executed.
The processor asks each ISA module in turn if it wants to handle the instruction, and uses the first module to say yes.
If the ISA module returns a new PC value it is immediately applied, otherwise it is automatically incremented.
This structure easily represents basic RISC-V architectures, and can scale up to support many different new modules.
