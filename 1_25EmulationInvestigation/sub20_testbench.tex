\section{Developing the testbench}\label{chap:software:sec:testbench}

\subsection{Vectorized memcpy}

\subsubsection{Strip-mining paradigm?}

\subsection{Emitting vector instructions}
\subsubsection{Auto-vectorization}
\subsubsection{Intrinsics}
\subsubsection{Inline ASM}
% CHERI-Clang has undocumented "c" constraint
\subsubsection{Comparison vs. Arm SVE}

\subsection{CHERI-Clang issues}
\subsubsection{Using CHERI-Clang from scratch}
% i.e. the things we had to do because CHERIbuild wasn't setting the arguments for us
\subsubsection{Updating RVV instructions to use capabilities}
\subsubsection{Experiments with ASM wrappers}
% Tried ASM wrappers, didn't work because can't return/pass vectors as args (cite ABI)
% Therefore moved to ASM 
\subsubsection{Allocating vectors on the stack}
% ASM wrappers also exposed that CHERI fails to something
\subsubsection{Other}
% note difference with CJALR/JALR?
