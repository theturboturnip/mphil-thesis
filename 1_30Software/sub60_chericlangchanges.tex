\section{Recommended changes for CHERI-Clang}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build on current work to make all RVV memory access instructions and pseudoinstructions CHERI-compatible.
    \item Make RVV memory access intrinsics take capabilities as arguments when compiled in pure-capability mode.
    \item Consider options on handling stack bounds for scalable vectors, and implement in the CheriBoundAllocas IR pass.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \todomark{could turn off stack bounds?}
        \item Could compute stack bounds at runtime.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
% \todomark{where to put something on how CHERI-Clang should change?}
