\section{Recommended changes for CHERI-Clang}\label{chap:software:sec:chericlangchanges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build on current work to make all RVV memory access instructions and pseudoinstructions CHERI-compatible.
    \item Make RVV memory access intrinsics take capabilities as arguments when compiled in pure-capability mode.
    \item Consider options on handling stack bounds for scalable vectors, and implement in the CheriBoundAllocas IR pass.
\end{itemize}
% \todomark{where to put something on how CHERI-Clang should change?}
