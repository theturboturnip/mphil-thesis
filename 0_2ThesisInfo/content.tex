Main chapters (excluding front-matter, references, appendix): \pagedifference{wc:start}{wc:end} (pp~\pageref{wc:start}-\pageref{wc:end})

Main chapters word count: \luadirect{tex.sprint(format_thousand(wordcount))} words

Word count methodology: \texttt{\luadirect{tex.sprint(wordcount_cmd)}}\\
This counts body text, heading text, caption text, and slightly over-counts references.
The anonymous version redacts some trivially identifying information, but uses the same word count as the de-anonymized version.
The appendices contain non-essential data that is summarized in the main text (e.g. full results, details on how to compile code), or re-statements of work done in the main text (e.g. a summary of all changes made to the CHERI-RISC-V spec).
